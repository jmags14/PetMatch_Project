PetMatch is a full-stack pet adoption web application built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and the Petfinder API. 
Users can browse available pets and "heart" or "skip" them in a Tinder-style interface. 
The app also allows users to filter pets by type, gender, and location, and view previously saved or skipped pets.
This project demonstrates: Full CRUD functionality, Integration with an external API (Petfinder), Database modeling with SQLAlchemy, Dynamic front-end interactions using JavaScript and AJAX.

Note: You must use your own Petfinder API key and secret to run the app. Sign up for free here: https://www.petfinder.com/developers
